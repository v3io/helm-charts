# spark-operator

A Helm chart for Spark on Kubernetes operator

## Introduction

This chart bootstraps a [Kubernetes Operator for Apache Spark](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/spark-on-k8s-operator) deployment using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

## Prerequisites

- Helm >= 3
- Kubernetes >= 1.13

## Previous Helm Chart

The previous `spark-operator` Helm chart hosted at [helm/charts](https://github.com/helm/charts) has been moved to this repository in accordance with the [Deprecation timeline](https://github.com/helm/charts#deprecation-timeline). Note that a few things have changed between this version and the old version:

- This repository **only** supports Helm chart installations using Helm 3+ since the `apiVersion` on the chart has been marked as `v2`.
- Previous versions of the Helm chart have not been migrated, and the version has been set to `1.0.0` at the onset. If you are looking for old versions of the chart, it's best to run `helm pull incubator/sparkoperator --version <your-version>` until you are ready to move to this repository's version.
- Several configuration properties have been changed, carefully review the [values](#values) section below to make sure you're aligned with the new values.

## Installing the chart

```shell

$ helm repo add spark-operator https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/spark-on-k8s-operator

$ helm install my-release spark-operator/spark-operator
```

This will create a release of `spark-operator` in the default namespace. To install in a different one:

```shell
$ helm install -n spark my-release spark-operator/spark-operator
```

Note that `helm` will fail to install if the namespace doesn't exist. Either create the namespace beforehand or pass the `--create-namespace` flag to the `helm install` command.

## Uninstalling the chart

To uninstall `my-release`:

```shell
$ helm uninstall my-release
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release, except for the `crds`, those will have to be removed manually.

| metrics.portName | string | `metrics` | Metrics port name |
| metrics.prefix | string | `""` | Metric prefix, will be added to all exported metrics |
| nameOverride | string | `""` | String to partially override `spark-operator.fullname` template (will maintain the release name) |
| nodeSelector | object | `{}` | Node labels for pod assignment |
| podAnnotations | object | `{}` | Additional annotations to add to the pod |
| podMonitor.enable | bool| `false` | Submit a prometheus pod monitor for operator's pod. Note that prometheus metrics should be enabled as well.|
| podMonitor.labels | object | `{}` | Pod monitor labels |
